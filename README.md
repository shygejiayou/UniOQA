# UniOQA: A Unified Framework for Knowledge Graph Question Answering with Large Language Models

## **Notice**

ðŸš¨ **This repository contains a distilled version of the experimental code used in our paper. It is the original implementation deployed on our internal server and is shared for learning and research purposes only.**  


To run the code, you need to download the **OwnThink knowledge graph** and place the processed files under the `processed_output_text_files` directory.  
Make sure the data is correctly formatted.

If you wish to reproduce our results, please refer to the official HuggingFace training pipeline and download the checkpoints we have released.
